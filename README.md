# Horiseon Website Challenge

## Description

So far this week we learned about HMTL, CSS, and how to use GitHub. In this challenge, we were already provided the HTML and CSS codes for the webpage. This project was used to see if we understood the general workflow of a new developer. Our job was to look at the existing code and make the necessary changes to clean up redundancies without disrupting the view or functionality of the website. We also needed to make the website more accessible. This was done by including alternate texts for images and icons that are displayed.

## Website

Here is a screenshot of the webpage after I modified the existing HTML and CSS.
